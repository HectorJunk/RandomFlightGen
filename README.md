# RandomFlightGen

Simple and unpolished Windows Forms app to generate random departure and destination ICAO codes for airports based on Continent or Countries selected.

When Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 was released I just wanted a quick way of getting a random trip within a specified distance from somewhere random in the world rather than having to decide where to fly so I created this. Nowadays (2024+) there are probably hundreds of free apps available (probably from flight.io) to do a much better job. I never thought it was worth the time to really polish it up or make it a web app.

Airport data was freely obtained from https://ourairports.com/data. By default the Project Settings file (app.config) points to the Airports Data CSV sub folder. If you want to change it then change it via Project/RandomFlightGen Properties...
